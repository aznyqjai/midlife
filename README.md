Sample 'About us' description.

Who are we? 
We are an eager bunch of former
professionals that have made a bold 
career change to become web developers,
designers, a.k.a. CODERS! 

For one reason or another, at some point 
in the recent past, we all decided that our
lives needed revamping and set out to 
do something about it. 

Coding, or rather web development, is a 
rapidly growing industry chock full of 
opportunities for people of all ages. 
In essence we met as students enrolled in the WDI
(web development intensive) course at 
the New York Code + Design Academy (link to NYCDA),
and have joined forces to help others like ourselves
make the transition into this new and exciting career! 

Have a look around the site to check out the
