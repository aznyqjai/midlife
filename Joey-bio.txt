Joey's bio

I have been married to my wife, Mary, for 16 years. We have two boys, Joey Jr. (14), and Jake (13). We have been in Wisconsin for the last 8 1/2 years. It has been a great 8 1/2 years up here, even with the cold winters. But, Mary's job has aksed her to work full time in Atlanta. It's not a terrible place for me since I grew up 3 hours away in Gadsden, AL. Plus we are much closer to the beach!

As you can see from some of my pictures, I enjoy fishing, golfing, and doing things with the family. We like to go on vacation, at least, once a year. We have a boat, so we will take that to a lake house and ride tubes or fish for a day. Our boys really keep us busy. I feel as though we have the best of both worlds with our two boys. One is into every sport and really successful, I might add. And the older boy is really into computers, gaming, and coding. He's our "goto" guy when we get new phones or computers.

I have worked in the engineering field as a mechanical designer for the last 16 years. Through those years I have been downsized a few times and find myself starting over again. With this move, I decided to just take the plunge and make a career change. I don't have any experience with coding, so I know it will be a challenge. But, I know I need to make a change and plan to work as hard as I need to in order to be successful.
